Index.js is the core code for the bot. The Discord bot allows users to whitelist themselves as well as view the in-game chat and various global server statistics all within Discord.
Within the code:
[MACHINE IP] is the ip address or FQDN that your Pelican Panel is assigned to.
[SERVER ID] is the id of the server you setup within the Pelican Panel.
[API KEY] is the key you can generate within the panel to use the API.
[CHANNEL ID] is the id of the Discord channel you wish for the bot to send messages to.
